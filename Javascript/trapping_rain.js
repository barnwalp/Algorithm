// Problem:
// Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of
// each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

// Constraint:
// 1. y-axis not to be considered for trapping water.
// 2. Array contains only not-negative numbers.
// 3. Minimum 1 number is present in the array

// Testcases:
let testCase1 = [1];                          //0
let testCase2 = [2,3,2,1];                    //0
let testCase3 = [1,2];                        //0
let testCase4 = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1];    //6
